      Harmattan, named after the trade winds that blow during the dry season in
      West Africa, is designed in a Warsh style to suit the needs of languages
      using the Arabic script in West Africa.
      
      This release supports virtually all of the Unicode 13.0 Arabic character
      repertoire (excluding the Quranic annotation signs in the Arabic Extended-A
      block and excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not
      recommended for normal use). Font smarts are implemented using OpenType
      and Graphite technologies.
      
      This font uses state-of-the-art OpenType and Graphite font technologies,
      including variant glyphs for a number of characters for use in particular
      contexts.
      
      This font provides a simplified rendering of Arabic script, using basic
      connecting glyphs but not including a wide variety of additional ligatures
      or contextual alternates (only the required lam-alef ligatures). This
      simplified style is often preferred for clarity, especially in non-Arabic
      languages, but may be considered unattractive in more traditional and
      literate communities.
      
      Two fonts from this typeface family are included in this release:
      
      * Harmattan Regular
      * Harmattan Bold
      
      For detailed documentation see the contents of the 'documentation' folder.
      
      A Note Regarding the Open Font License and TypeTuner
      ----------------------------------------------------
      
      The OFL prohibits the use of Reserved Font Names "Fouta", "Harmattan" and
      "SIL" in the name of any font that is derived from the Original Version of
      Harmattan. However, SIL International (the Copyright Holder) grants
      through this separate written agreement the right to use the Reserved Font
      Names in any Modified Version of this font created by using TypeTuner as
      long as the feature information contained in the Original Version is used,
      unmodified, as the source for TypeTuner feature information, and
      "Harmattan" is not the resulting font family name.
      
      TypeTuner-produced fonts created in this manner are still bound by the
      terms of the OFL. Specifically, the use of Reserved Font Names is
      prohibited when making derivatives of a TypeTuner-produced font. Anyone
      making a derivative of a TypeTuner font will need to find a different
      name. For example a TypeTuner-produced font may be named
      "Harmattan SomeFarAwayPlace" but a derivative of that font made
      with other tools would not be allowed to use the "Fouta", "Harmattan"
      and "SIL" Reserved Font Names and would have to be named something like
      "Nations Ajami".
