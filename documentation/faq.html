    <p>A generic FAQ for all of our Arabic scripts fonts can be found
    here: <a
    href="https://software.sil.org/arabicfonts/support/faq/">Arabic
    Fonts - FAQ</a>. FAQ's specific to Harmattan are found below.</p>
    <h3 id="problems-with-bold-weights">Problems with Bold weights</h3>
    <h4
    id="why-does-my-application-not-show-the-bold-weight-in-font-menus-and-dialogs"><em>Why
    does my application not show the Bold weight in font menus and
    dialogs?</em></h4>
    <p>Some applications will list all the weights but leave out Bold.
    To access the Bold you need to choose Regular and turn on Bold using
    the application's UI controls such as a "B" button.</p>
    <h4 id="why-do-i-sometimes-get-a-fake-bold"><em>Why do I sometimes
    get a fake Bold?</em></h4>
    <p>If you choose a weight other than Regular (such as Medium), then
    use application controls to turn on Bold, some applications will
    make a "fake" Bold rather than use one of the real ones in the font
    (Medium, SemiBold, Bold). This is because only Regular has an
    associated Bold counterpart. This is a technical limitation with
    some apps and OSes. If you are using some other weight than Regular
    for text and want to make a word or phrase stand out you will need
    to select the text and apply one of the heavier weights
    manually.</p>
    <h3 id="what-characters-are-included-with-this-release"><em>What
    characters are included with this release?</em></h3>
    <p>See <a href="charset.html">Character Set Support</a> for the full
    listing.</p>
    <h3
    id="i-notice-that-harmattan-is-missing-a-number-of-characters-that-i-would-like.-will-you-add-these"><em>I
    notice that Harmattan is missing a number of characters that I would
    like. Will you add these?</em></h3>
    <p>It is impossible for us to add every glyph that every person
    desires, but we do place a high priority on adding complete coverage
    of all the characters defined in Unicode for Arabic script
    (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not
    recommended for normal use). You can send us your requests, but
    please understand that we are unlikely to add symbols where the user
    base is very small, unless they have been accepted into Unicode.</p>
    <h3 id="what-is-so-special-about-harmattan"><em>What is so special
    about Harmattan?</em></h3>
    <p><strong>Harmattan</strong> is designed in a Warsh style to suit
    the needs of languages using the Arabic script in West Africa. This
    font is designed to work with the OpenType font technology. To take
    advantage of the advanced typographic capabilities of this font, you
    must be using applications that provide an adequate level of support
    for OpenType. These advanced capabilities provide access to the
    variant character forms used in some languages. See <a
    href="features.html">Smart Font Features</a>.</p>
