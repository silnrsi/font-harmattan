DOCUMENTATION
Harmattan
========================

The documentation for this project is listed in index.html.

There are also PDF versions in the `pdf` folder.

These are produced from markdown sources (in `source`) using pandoc,
weasyprint, and custom python scripts. See the `makedocs` shell script
in the main project folder.

FYI: There is a problem with language features for wol/wo in features.md. 
Our pdf maker requires the 3 letter codes and html requires 2 letter codes. It is best
to open the .html file and create a pdf manually.
