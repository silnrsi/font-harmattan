    <h4 id="known-issues">Known issues</h4>
    <p>At the time of the Harmattan 2.000 release there is a known issue for printing with Harmattan in Word 2019 and Word 365. Printing to a printer or to pdf may cause a reh-like glyph to shift in its advanced width. The result is that there appears to be a small space between the preceding character and the reh-like character. Microsoft is working on releasing an update that includes a fix for this issue. Once Microsoft releases the update, the solution to this issue will be to update Microsoft Office. You can do this by opening a document in Word and go to <strong>File &gt; Account &gt; Update Options &gt; Update Now</strong>.</p>
