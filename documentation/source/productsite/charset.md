The Harmattan font supports virtually all of the Unicode 13.0 Arabic character repertoire (excluding the Quranic annotation signs in the Arabic Extended-A block and excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not recommended for normal use).

[Arabic (U+0600..U+06FF)](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0600.pdf) was added to Unicode 1.0. [Arabic Supplement (U+0750..U+077F)](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0750.pdf) was added to Unicode 4.1, [Arabic Extended-A (U+08A0..U+08FF)](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U08A0.pdf) was added to Unicode 6.1, and [Arabic Extended-B (U+0870..U+089F)](http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0870.pdf) was added to Unicode 14.0. We do not yet provide support for Unicode 14.0. There are still some Arabic script characters being added to Unicode, so it is possible that not all languages using the Arabic script are fully represented in Unicode.
