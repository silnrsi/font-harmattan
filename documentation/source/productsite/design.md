The original font on which Harmattan was based was an [OFL](http://scripts.sil.org/ofl)-licensed typeface called **Fouta AS**, designed for one specific region in West Africa. However, significant design changes have been made as the font has been extended to handle a wider variety of languages using the Arabic script. Harmattan, named after the trade winds that blow during the dry season in West Africa, is designed in a Warsh style to suit the needs of languages using the Arabic script in West Africa. The Latin letters are a subset of the [Andika](http://software.sil.org/andika) font. 

Four fonts from this typeface family are included in the *Harmattan* release:

- Harmattan Regular
- Harmattan Medium
- Harmattan SemiBold
- Harmattan Bold
