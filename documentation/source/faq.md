A generic FAQ for all of our Arabic scripts fonts can be found here: [Arabic Fonts - FAQ](http://software.sil.org/arabicfonts/support/faq/). FAQ's specific to Harmattan are found below.

#### *What characters are included with this release?*

See [Character Set Support](charset.md) for the full listing.

#### *I notice that Harmattan is missing a number of characters that I would like. Will you add these?*

It is impossible for us to add every glyph that every person desires, but we do place a high priority on adding complete coverage of all the characters defined in Unicode for Arabic script (excluding the Arabic Presentation Forms blocks, which are not recommended for normal use). You can send us your requests, but please understand that we are unlikely to add symbols where the user base is very small, unless they have been accepted into Unicode.

#### *What is so special about Harmattan?*

**Harmattan** is designed in a Warsh style to suit the needs of languages using the Arabic script in West Africa. This font is designed to work with two advanced font technologies, [Graphite](http://graphite.sil.org) and OpenType. To take advantage of the advanced typographic capabilities of this font, you must be using applications that provide an adequate level of support for Graphite or OpenType. These advanced capabilities provide access to the variant character forms used in some languages. See [Smart Font Features](features.md).
