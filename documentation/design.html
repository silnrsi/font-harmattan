    </header>
    <p>The original font on which Harmattan was based was an <a href="https://openfontlicense.org/">OFL</a>-licensed typeface called <strong>Fouta AS</strong>, designed for one specific region in West Africa. However, significant design changes have been made as the font has been extended to handle a wider variety of languages using the Arabic script. Harmattan, named after the trade winds that blow during the dry season in West Africa, is designed in a Warsh style to suit the needs of languages using the Arabic script in West Africa. The Latin letters are a subset of the <a href="https://software.sil.org/andika">Andika</a> font.</p>
    <p>Four fonts from this typeface family are included in the <em>Harmattan</em> release:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Harmattan Regular</li>
    <li>Harmattan Medium</li>
    <li>Harmattan SemiBold</li>
    <li>Harmattan Bold</li>
    </ul>
